Proposal for INCF Training in neuroinformatics: Software development for
 reproducible neuroimaging research in Python.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

Topic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align block
As the complexity of computational methods used in scientific research increases
, there is also an increasing awareness of the need to develop methods to
 maintain the reproducibility of research results (as expressed, for example,
 in an editorial in 
\emph on
Nature
\emph default
 on February 17th, 2011).
 This concern is particularly pertinent for neuroimaging, a field which
 often requires many steps of computation to be performed on large, complex
 data sets.
 Python is increasingly becoming the lingua franca of reproducible research
 in many fields, including neuroscience.
 This course will teach neuroimaging researchers to use modern open-source
 software development tools, in order to conduct reproducible research.
 The course will teach best practices in software development (“software
 carpentry”, 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://software-carpentry.org"

\end_inset

), as well as specific solutions to analysis problems in neuroimaging, with
 an emphasis on problem-solving with real data.
 The first day of the course will focus on the basic Python stack of tools
 for scientific programming (version control, ipython, numpy, scipy, matplotlib,
 etc.).
 Days 2-4 will each be divided into three two-hour sessions devoted to general
 topics, such as statistics, machine learning, time series analysis, and
 visualization, as well as presenting several neuroimaging-specific Python
 libraries including nipy, dipy, nibabel, nitime, pymvpa, and nipype (see
 http://nipy.org).
 The last day of the course will have the students work in small groups
 (2-3 people) on selected team projects to analyze real data using the tools
 we've presented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align block
The course will fill gaps in the traditional training of practitioners of
 neuroimaging: though some scientists in this field receive formal training
 in programming and fundamentals of computer science, there is very little
 training available in neuroinformatics.
 In order to focus the scope of the course, we have defined the following
 three major goals of learning: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
\align block
Participants will acquire computing practices to facilitate reproducible
 research.
 This included knowledge in practices of scientific software engineering
 and knowledge of specific tools for version control, data handling, collaborati
on and documentation, which facilitate these practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
\align block
Participants will acquire knowledge and skills in neuroimaging data analysis.
 In particular, participants will acquire domain-specific knowledge in a
 variety of topics in modern neuroimaging, including diffusion imaging,
 time-series analysis, machine learning, graph-theory, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
\align block
Through interaction with instructors and practical exercises, participants
 will gain confidence in their programming skills and will increase their
 capacity to productively perform reproducible computational analysis, to
 answer a variety of scientific questions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align block
Fulfilling these goals will also provide us with a clear measure of the
 success of the training.

) interested in learning best practices in the use and development of reproducib
le research tools.
 The target audience are researchers with some programming experience in
 Python, C/C++, or Matlab.
 The course will admit 30 participants, to maintain a good instructor/student
 ratio.
 In particular, we will seek to make the course available to members of
 groups under-represented in neuroinformatics.

Content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each day of the workshop will contain three two-hour sessions of instruction.
 The sessions will be interactive, allowing students to learn by doing.
 Typically, the instruction sessions will be structured as 20 minute lecture
 segments, interleaved with 10-20 minute problem solving sessions.
 During these sessions, students will work on solving a narrowly defined
 programming problem, using the library or tool that is being presented
 during that segment.
 For example, an incomplete code segment will be provided and students will
 be asked to write the remaining code, to complete the exercise.
 This form of instruction requires a high level of student engagement.
 The high instructor-to-student ratio will allow instructors to help individual
 students in solving these problem sets during these segments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following, we will briefly describe the contents of each of the sessions
 in the above time-table.
 In addition to these formal sessions, we will hold several informal 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 sessions, in which instructors and students can present a topic of interest
 or a software tool in addition to those presented in the more formal instructio
n sessions.
 Topics for these sessions include: software deployment strategies, software
 testing, and stimulus generation and presentation for perceptual exepriments.

\begin_layout Standard
We discuss the packages that extend Python for numerical computing, beyond
 what is part of the language.
 We present the use of the IPython environment for an efficient workflow
 (including debugging, profiling and access to help), and explore the use
 of Numpy arrays, their connection to other data structures in the language
 (lists, dicts and sets), their numerical capabilities, slicing and indexing,
 masking and the notion of structured arrays.
 We conclude with a brief overview of SciPy.

Machine learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This session introduces attendees to machine-learning techniques used in
 neuroimaging.
 First we present inverse inference: using the PyMVPA toolkit we analyse
 the dataset of Haxby et al 2001 using various analyses schemes: from searchligh
t analysis to ROI/full-brain classification while introducing the concepts
 such as cross-validation and feature selection.
 Second we explore more of general machine learning concepts such as unsupervise
d learning and penalization.
 We demonstrate them using the scikit-learn toolkit.

Visualization 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first part of this session exposes how to visualize neuroimaging data.
 We start by introducy the nipy functions to perform 2D and 3D visualization
 of MRI volumes.
 Then we show how, underlying nipy, the 3D visualizations are created with
 Mayavi.
 Finally, we give an overview of the Mayavi pipeline and use it to new visualiza
tions of various datasets.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In the second part, we demonstrate how to create a simple Graphical User
 Interface for a Python class using Traits and TraitsGUI.
 Such GUIs are helpful for instance in data entry or parameter control.
 The created GUIs can be integrated in larger application architectures.
 We give a brief overview of how this is done in the Connectome Viewer which
 extends Mayavi using the Envisage plugin architecture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

 women and scientists from countries outside the developed world) and encourage
 members of these groups to apply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
\noindent
Requirements: Programming experience in Python, Matlab or C/C++ and a strong
 interest in learning software development tools is expected.
 In addition, prior experience or theoretical background in neuroimaging
 (fMRI, MRI, EEG, or other techniques) is assumed.

target "http://sphinx.pocoo.org/"

\end_inset

).
 Thus, all the teaching materials (slides, scripts, problem sets and full
 solutions) and the projects written by the participants, will be compiled
 and disseminated on the INCF website, will be integrated into the documentation
 of the nipy software projects and will become part of the online documentation
 of these software projects, which is freely available.
 In addition, the course sessions will be video-taped and made available
 through the INCF.

Benefit and relevance to INCF mission
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align block
As mentioned in the INCF mission statement, neuroinformatics poses a specific
 challenge for training, as the variety of knowledge and research cultures
 comprising neuroinformatics is only rarely combined in one single place
 and often falls at the boundaries of traditional academic departments.
 The training we propose will draw on the combined experience and knowledge
 of several different neuroinformatics practitioners and provides one of
 these rare opportunities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align block
The list of instructors proposed embodies the spirit of international cooperatio
n, which underlies the mission of the INCF, with instructors from the US,
 from France, from Switzerland, from Germany and from the UK.
 We intend for the student population to embody this spirit, at least in
 part, by inviting international participants to apply for travel grants,
 which will cover the expenses of 5 such students.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align block
Among the three components of neuroinformatics (tools, models and data-bases),
 this course is aimed mostly at tool-development and data analysis.
 However, other topics such as data-base and data-sharing will be discussed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align block
Of the core competencies defined in the summary of the 1st INCF Workshop
 on Needs for Training in Neuroinformatics held in Edinburgh in July 23-25,
 2008 (page 6), this course will thoroughly address the following three:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
\align block
“Knowledge of stochastic modeling, time-series analysis, exploratory data
 analysis and applied statistics”.
 These topics are extremely relevant for neuroimaging and will be covered
 both at the theoretical level, as well as at the practical level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
\align block
“Ability to program in high-level languages”.
 Although we expect many of the participants to have at least some knowledge
 of programming, one of the the major goals of the course is to increase
 participants’ confidence in their programming skills to a degree where
 they will be able to publicly share the code they use for their analysis,
 making their analysis reproducible by others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
\align block
“Knowledge of imaging techniques and image analysis”: This topic is also
 central to the course an will be covered extensively, both at the theoretical
 level and at the practical level.
